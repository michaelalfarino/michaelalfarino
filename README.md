Hey there! I'm Michael, a data enthusiast and fresh grad from ITB. I've got a thing for Python, stats, and machine learning algorithms. Curiosity is my superpower, and I'm on a mission to apply data-driven magic to real-world challenges. Let's geek out together and turn data into something awesome as a data scientist!
